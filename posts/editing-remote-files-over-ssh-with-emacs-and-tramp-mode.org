In a discussion over a beer, a friend of mine asked whether I know a way to edit remote files over ~ssh~? It was then that I realized that my long time obsession with Emacs is starting to pay off and I gave him the only way I know how to do that: *Emacs and [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp Mode]]*.

This is how I do it.
* Setup
  I use ~Emacs 25.2~ on Kubuntu 17.04 and on Windows 10 using [[http://cygwin.com/][Cygwin]] and when working with remote files both systems behave the same.
* The flow
  1. Configure the remote machine to authenticate you with a key file as specified in this [[https://askubuntu.com/a/20921/561980][stackoverflow answer]]
  2. Start Emacs
  To open the remote file for editing invoke the ~find-file~ command either using ~C-x C-f~ (~C = Ctrl~) or with ~M-x find-file~ (~M=Alt~) and at the file prompt specify the path in the following format:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    /ssh:user@ip[:port]:path/to/file
  #+END_SRC
* An example
  To exemplify let's consider the following scenario: I have a virtual machine with the IP ~192.168.13.13~ to which I can connect remotely with ~ssh~ using the username ~petru~ and the default public key (*~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub*). On that machine I want to edit the file ~/home/petru/src/debugutils.py~.

  To do so, I open the file as usually in Emacs using ~C-x C-f~ and at the prompt (the minibuffer) I enter the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    /ssh:petru@192.168.13.13:/home/petru/src/debugutils.py
  #+END_SRC
  and press ~<Enter>~.
