    <p>
A few weeks ago, while working on a hackathon project I found myself very disappointed with my progress.
</p>

<p>
I had the impression that I can do better but something is holding me back and then I realized that I was too distracted by <code>Alt-Tab</code>-ing through all open applications, iterating through dozens of open tabs in the browser and spending too much time on websites that were of no use at that time.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, on a whim I decided to try and eliminate all of these distractions the hard way - <b>by not using the X server at all</b> (I was working on <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>).
</p>

<p>
Since I was mainly working with Python code and occasionally I would need to open some file for inspection and all of these were done from Emacs I said to myself:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Emacs can be opened from console so why not start working on hackathon from console?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Said and done. <code>Ctrl-Alt-F1</code> and I was prompted with the TTY cursor. I logged in, started Emacs opened all the required files and started working. All good until I found myself in the situation where I needed to lookup something on the Internet. I knew I could use <code>eww</code> as a web browser so normally I did so (yeah, I'm one of those people that use Bing instead of Google):
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>M-x<span class="w"> </span>eww
Enter<span class="w"> </span>URL<span class="w"> </span>or<span class="w"> </span>keywords:<span class="w"> </span>www.bing.com
</pre></div>
<p>
And nothing… Oh, wait, I remember needing to enter some username and password when connecting to the Wi-Fi but I wasn't prompted for those after logging into terminal. How do I connect to the network?
</p>

<p>
As there was no way for me to find that out without using some sort of GUI (I'm not that good with terminals) I started a new X session, connected from there to Wi-Fi and found this <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/461831/561980">StackOverflow answer</a>. So I logged back to the terminal and from Emacs started <b>eshell</b> with <code>M-x eshell</code>. From there I issued the following command
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nmcli<span class="w"> </span>c<span class="w"> </span>up<span class="w"> </span>&lt;wi-fi-name&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
which connected me to the Wi-Fi network.
</p>

<p>
Note: I got connected because on previous sessions I opted to store the credentials for the connection; to get a prompt for username and password for the Wi-Fi use the <code>--ask</code> parameter like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nmcli<span class="w"> </span>--ask<span class="w"> </span>c<span class="w"> </span>up<span class="w"> </span>&lt;wi-fi-name&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
After connecting I resumed my coding and only at the end of the hackathon I stopped to ponder upon my experience; it wasn't as smooth as I expected. Although I consider a big plus the fact that I was able to issue shell commands within Emacs through <b>eshell</b> there were some hick-ups along the way.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I noticed is that under terminal not all shortcuts that are very familiar for me are available. Namely, in <b>org-mode</b> the combination <code>M-right</code> which is used for indentation, moving columns within a table and demoting list items is not available; instead I had to use either <code>C-c C-x r</code> shortcut or explicitly invoke the command using <code>M-x org-meta-right</code>. Although I did not invoke this command frequently, without the shortcut I felt like I was pulled out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">the flow</a> each time I had to use an alternative method of invoking the command.
</p>

<p>
The second and by far the biggest nuisance was the lack of proper web-browsing experience. Although I most frequently landed on StackOverflow pages and although <b>eww</b> rendered them pretty good (see image below) the lack of visual experience <i>I was used to</i> gave me a sense of discomfort.

<p>
However, when I got to analyze how much I have accomplished while working from terminal I was simply <b>amazed</b>. Having no distraction and meaningless motion like cycling through windows and tabs had a huge impact on my productivity. I was able to fully concentrate and immerse in the code and by doing so I had <b>a lot</b> of work done.
